1|true|streamsetup| I use 32 bit OBS to stream to twitch, with several plugins from NightDev in order to get follower alerts and the like! My setting up background is what happens when you let a fox do a serious project in MSPaint in the early AM! The visualizer I use is the VSXU_player/custom visualizer! My connection speed is 100 MB/s Download, and 30 MB/s Upload, any connection problems is either Router end or Twitch end since I do not have a gaming router yet!
